# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/brandonmbehring-dev/research-kb/security/advisories/new) to submit your report. This ensures the issue is handled privately until a fix is available.

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: within 7 days
- **Fix**: depends on severity, typically within 30 days

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version on the `main` branch receives security updates.

## Scope

This policy covers the `research-kb` codebase and its demo infrastructure. Third-party dependencies (PostgreSQL, KuzuDB, sentence-transformers) should be reported to their respective maintainers.
